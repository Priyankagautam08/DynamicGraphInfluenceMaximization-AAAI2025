# Dynamic Graph Influence Maximization - AAAI 2025  

This repository contains the **code, datasets, and paper** associated with our research on **Dynamic Influence Maximization in Evolving Networks**, accepted at **AAAI-25**.  

## üîç Overview  
- Influence Maximization (**InfMax**) is a fundamental problem in **network science**, focusing on identifying the most influential nodes in a network.  
- Traditional approaches assume **static networks**, which is unrealistic for evolving systems (e.g., **social media, traffic, biological networks**).  
- We propose a **GNN-BiLSTM-based adaptive framework** that efficiently tracks **influential nodes** while reducing computational overhead.

üìÑ **[Download Full Paper](https://github.com/Priyankagautam08/DynamicGraphInfluenceMaximization-AAAI2025/blob/main/AAAI25_Dynamic_Infmax.pdf)**  

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Dynamic Network Adaptability:** Handles evolving structures over time.  
- **Efficient Candidate Node Selection:** Uses **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to predict influential nodes.  
- **Faster Computation:** Achieves **2√ó speedup** over traditional **Greedy algorithms** while maintaining influence spread.  
- **Scalability:** Works on both **small and large-scale networks** (320 ‚Äì 11,492 nodes).
  
## üìä Experimental Setup  
- **Datasets:** Real-world (SNAP, Email-Eu-core, College-Msg) and synthetic (Barabasi-Albert, Erd≈ës-R√©nyi).  
- **Hardware:** Experiments conducted on **Intel i9-12900K & NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU**.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, computational efficiency, and influence spread.
